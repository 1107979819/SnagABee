# SnagABee
Helps decode the message payload using Texas Instrument's Zigbee Sniffer application.

Snag-A-Bee is very basic and was used to help decode the Zigbee message protocol for the Yuneec Q500 drone. It may help with other uses as well. However, you must hard coded for a specific controller ID. Unless you make changes to the code to make this more user friendly. 

The Texas Instrument Zigbee Sniffer application is available for download here:
